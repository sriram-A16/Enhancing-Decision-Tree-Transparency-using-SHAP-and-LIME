# Interpretable Drug Classification for Personalized Medicine

This project presents an AI-driven approach to drug prescription classification using a Decision Tree model. By analyzing key patient metrics, the system predicts the most suitable drug class and, more importantly, explains the reasoning behind its predictions using state-of-the-art interpretability techniques like SHAP and LIME.

The ultimate goal is to create a transparent, reliable, and accurate tool that can aid clinicians in making data-driven decisions for personalized patient care.

## Project Overview

In modern medicine, selecting the optimal drug for a patient based on their specific health profile is a critical challenge. This project tackles this challenge by building a machine learning model that classifies drugs based on patient data. We employ a Decision Tree classifier for its inherent simplicity and supplement it with advanced Explainable AI (XAI) methods to ensure that every prediction is transparent and understandable. The model is rigorously trained and evaluated using a 70/30 train-test split, cross-validation, and a comprehensive suite of performance metrics.

## The Problem

  - **One-Size-Fits-All Medicine:** Traditional approaches may not always account for the unique interplay of factors like blood pressure, cholesterol, and metabolic rates in individual patients.
  - **"Black Box" AI:** Many advanced machine learning models operate as "black boxes," making it difficult for clinicians to trust or understand their recommendations.
  - **Lack of Transparency:** Without a clear explanation, an AI-generated recommendation cannot be confidently integrated into a patient's treatment plan.

## Our Solution

This project implements a transparent classification system that:

1.  **Predicts** the most effective drug class (`Drug A, B, C, X, Y`) for a patient.
2.  **Explains** the key factors driving that prediction (e.g., "DrugY was chosen primarily due to a high Sodium-to-Potassium ratio").
3.  **Provides** both high-level (global) and patient-specific (local) insights into the model's decision-making logic.

## Key Features

  - **Accurate Classification:** A robust Decision Tree model for multi-class drug prediction.
  - **Model Interpretability:** Deep insights using **SHAP** for global feature importance and **LIME** for local, instance-specific explanations.
  - **Interaction Analysis:** **Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs)** to visualize the relationship between patient attributes and drug outcomes.
  - **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Assessed using a confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and k-fold cross-validation to ensure reliability and prevent overfitting.
  - **Visual Clarity:** Includes decision tree diagrams for a clear, flowchart-like representation of the model's logic.

## Tech Stack & Dependencies

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Python** | Core programming language |
| **Pandas** | Data manipulation and analysis |
| **Scikit-learn** | Machine learning (Decision Tree, metrics, cross-validation) |
| **Matplotlib & Seaborn**| Data visualization (plots, graphs) |
| **SHAP** | Explainable AI (Global & Local Interpretability) |
| **LIME**| Explainable AI (Local Interpretability) |

## Dataset

The model is trained on the `drug200.csv` dataset, which includes the following patient attributes:

  - **Age**: Age of the patient
  - **Sex**: Gender of the patient
  - **BP**: Blood pressure level (HIGH, NORMAL, LOW)
  - **Cholesterol**: Cholesterol level (NORMAL, HIGH)
  - **Na\_to\_K**: Sodium-to-Potassium ratio in the blood
  - **Drug**: The prescribed drug (Target Variable)

The dataset can be accessed here: [Kaggle: Drug Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pablomgomez21/drugs-a-b-c-x-y-for-decision-trees)

## Project Workflow

1.  **Data Preprocessing:** Loading the dataset, encoding categorical features (Sex, BP, Cholesterol), and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
2.  **Model Training:** A `DecisionTreeClassifier` is trained on the preprocessed training data.
3.  **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is measured on the test set using a confusion matrix and classification report. K-fold cross-validation is performed to validate its stability.
4.  **Interpretability Analysis:** SHAP and LIME are applied to the trained model to generate explanations for its predictions at both a global and local level.

## Results & Key Insights

Our model serves as a powerful proof-of-concept for enhancing personalized medicine with transparent AI.

  - **Performance:** The Decision Tree classifier achieved an overall accuracy of **[Enter Your Accuracy, e.g., 98%]** on the test set, with high precision and recall for all drug classes.
  - **Global Insights (SHAP):** The SHAP summary plot revealed that the `Na_to_K` ratio is the most influential factor in determining drug prescriptions, followed by `BP` and `Age`. This provides a high-level understanding of the key biomarkers.
  - **Local Insights (LIME):** For individual predictions, LIME effectively highlighted the specific features that drove the decision. For example, a prediction for "Drug Y" for a given patient was primarily attributed to their `Na_to_K` ratio being above 15.
  - **Actionable & Transparent:** The combination of predictive accuracy and clear explanations makes this model a trustworthy tool for clinical support, allowing medical professionals to validate recommendations against their own expertise.
